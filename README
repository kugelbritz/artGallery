Admin Menu Passkey is 00252
If you're having issues adding new Data to ArtData.xlsx, feel free to add them manually through the excel,
all images are saved as "src/resources/images/'title_with_spaces'.jpg".
You'll want to add the art in succession, due to the fact that the art add from the top of the excel file, I predetermined some space at the beginning of the file just for that reason.
The logic for the iterator can be seen at the bottom of MyPanel.
Referring to my project proposal:
MyPanel is where I handle most of the ArtForm data.
Main Screen is where I handle my Viewing Screen data.
